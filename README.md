# cuda-image-processing
This is a personal project to learn more about CUDA and GPUs in a fun way by filtering images using user-provided convolution masks (defined in CSV format). It builds on concepts introduced in my Parallel Processing course (ECE 4530). At first, the CUDA kernel I developed for applying the convolution mask to an image used exclusively global memory. I then attempted a shared memory implementation that partitions the image into tiles and ensures that any halo rows required for the convolution are included in each block.

I avoided researching any tiling solutions to this task for the sake of problem solving, so there is likely a more efficient solution than my approach. While I do decrease the number of global memory accesses (and increase compute to global memory access ratio) substantially, I rarely see better performance over my global memory approach. I think this is likely due to coalesced memory accesses in the global memory implementation, which will occur because neighbouring threads access contiguous locations in memory throughout the convolution process.
